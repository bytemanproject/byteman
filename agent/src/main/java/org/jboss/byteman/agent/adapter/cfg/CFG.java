/**
 * A control flow graph (cfg) for use by trigger method adapters.<p/>
 * A trigger method adapter is required to notify the CFG each time an instruction or label is visited and
 * each time a try catch block is notified. It is also required to notify the CFG when trigger coe generartion
 * begins and ends. The cfg allows the trigger method adapter to identify whether or not trigger code is
 * within the scope of one or more synchronized blocks, allowing it to protect the trigger call with try catch
 * handlers which ensure that any open monitor enters are rounded off with a corresponding monitor exit.
 * <p/>
 * A cfg is constructed dynamically as the code is visited in order to enable trigger insertion to be performed
 * during a single pass of the bytecode. See {@link org.jboss.byteman.agent.adapter.RuleTriggerMethodAdapter}
 * for an example of how the methods provided by this class are invoked during visiting of the method byte code.
 * Methods provided for driving CFG construction include:
 * <ul>
 * <li> non-control instruction visit:
 *  {@link CFG#add(int)}, {@link CFG#add(int, int)},
 * {@link CFG#add(int, int, int)} {@link CFG#add(int, int[])}  {@link CFG#add(int, String)},
 * {@link CFG#add(int, String, String, String)}, {@link CFG#add(int, String, int)},
 * <li> control instruction visit:
 * {@link CFG#split(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}, {@link CFG#split(org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * {@link CFG#split(org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * {@link CFG#split(org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label[])},
 * <li> label visit:
 * {@link CFG#visitLabel(org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * <li> try/catch block visit:
 * {@link CFG#visitTryCatchBlock(org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label, org.objectweb.asm.Label, String)},
 * <li> trigger region demarcation:
 * {@link CFG#visitTriggerStart(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}, {@link CFG#visitTriggerEnd(org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * <li> code visit end demarcation:
 * {@link org.jboss.byteman.agent.adapter.cfg.CFG#visitMaxs()}, {@link org.jboss.byteman.agent.adapter.cfg.CFG#visitEnd()},
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * The cfg maintains the current instruction sequence for the method in encoded form as it is being generated.
 * The cfg models both the linear instruction sequence and the directed graph of control flow through that sequence.
 * It splits the instruction stream at control flow branch points, grouping instructions into basic blocks. A
 * successor link relation between blocks retains the linear instruction sequence. Control flow links between
 * basic blocks define the graph structure. The cfg correlates labels with i) blocks and ii) instruction offsets
 * within those blocks as the labels are visited during bytecode visiting. It also tracks the locations within
 * blocks of try catch regions and their handlers and of monitor enter and exit instructions.
 * <p/>
 * The lock propagation algorithm employed to track the extent of monitor enter/exit pairs and try/catch blocks is
 * the most complex aspect of this implementation, mainly because it has to be done in a single pass. This means
 * that the end location of a try catch block or the location of the (one or more) monitor exit(s) associated with
 * a monitor enter may not be known when a trigger point is reached. This algorithm is described below in detail.
 * First an explanation of the CFG organization is provided.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Control flow graph model</h3>
 * The bytecode sequence is segmented into basic blocks at control flow branches ensuring there is no <em>explicit</em>
 * control flow internal to a block. The only way <em>normal</em> control can flow from one block to another is via a
 * switch/goto/branch instruction occuring at the end of the block. So, basic blocks are the nodes of the CFG
 * and the links in the graph identify these control flow transitions.
 * <p>
 * Normal control flow linkage is explicitly
 * represented in the blocks as a list containing the labels of the target blocks. Labels are used rather than
 * handles on the block themselves so that forward links to blocks which have not yet been generated can be
 * modelled. Labels are resolved to the relevant block and instruction index as they are visited during walking
 * of the bytecode.
 * </p>
 * The outgoing control flow link count can be obtained by calling method
 * {@link BBlock#nOuts()}. The label of the block to which control is transferred can be identified by calling
 * method {@link BBlock#nthOut(int)}. Note that valid link indices run from 1 to nOuts() (see below). Once
 * a label has been visited it can be resolved to a {@link CodeLocation} by calling method
 * {@link CFG#getLocation(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}. The returned value identifies both a block and an instruction
 * offset in the block.
 * <p/>
 * Several caveats apply to this simple picture. Firstly, blocks ending in return or throw have no control flow -- they
 * pass control back to the caller rather than to another basic block. So, the count returned by {@link BBlock#nOuts()}
 * will be 0 for such blocks.
 * <p/>
 * Secondly, all blocks except the last have a distinguished link which identifies the block successor link
 * relationship. The successor block can be obtained by supplying value 0 as argument to method
 * {@link BBlock#nthOut(int)}. This link is <em>additional</em> to any control flow links and it is <em>not</em>
 * included in the count returned by {@link BBlock#nOuts()}. Note that where there is a control flow link to the
 * next block in line (e.g. where the block ends in an ifXX instruction) the label employed for the distinguished 0
 * link will also appear in the set of control flow links (as link 1 in the case of an ifXX instruction).
 * <p/>
 * The final caveat is that this graph model does not identify control flow which occurs as a consequence of
 * generated exceptions.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Exceptional Control Flow</h3>
 * Exception control flow is modelled independently from normal flow because it relates to a segment of the
 * instruction sequence rather than individual instructions. A specific exception flow is associated with a each
 * try catch block and the target of the flow is the start of the handler block. The cfg maintains a list of
 * {@link TryCatchDetails} which identify the location of the try/catch start, its end and the associated handler
 * start location. Once again labels are used so as to allow modelling of forward references to code locations
 * which have not yet been generated.
 * <p/>
 * Note that handler start labels always refer to a code location which is at the start of a basic block. Start
 * and end labels for a given try/catch block may refer to code locations offset into their containing basic block
 * and possibly in distinct blocks.
 * <p/>
 * Methods {@link #tryCatchStart(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}, {@link #tryCatchEnd(org.objectweb.asm.Label)}
 * and {@link #tryCatchHandlerStart(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} can be called to determine whether a given label
 * identifies, respectively, the start of a try catch block, the end of a try catch block or the start of a handler
 * block. Methods {@link #tryCatchStartDetails(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} {@link #tryCatchEndDetails(org.objectweb.asm.Label)},
 * and {@link #tryCatchHandlerStartDetails(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} can be used to retrieve the associated
 * {@link TryCatchDetails} information.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Label Resolution</h3>
 * The cfg relies upon its adapter client to notify it whenever a label is visited during a walk of the bytecode.
 * This allows it to associate labels with the basic blocks and instruction offsets within those blocks. The cfg
 * provides method {@link CFG#getBlock(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} to resolve the primary label for a block (i.e. the
 * one supplied as argument to a split call) to the associated block. It also provides method
 * {@link CFG#getBlockInstructionIdx(org.objectweb.asm.Label)} to resolve a label to a {@link CodeLocation} i.e.
 * block and instruction index within a block. Both methods return null if the label has not yet been visited.
 * <p/>
 * Method {@link CFG#getContains(BBlock)} is also provided to obtain a list of all labels contained within a
 * specific block. There may be more than one label which resolves to a location within a specific block. For
 * example, the handler start label associated with a try/catch handler is contained in the handler block at
 * offset 0 but is never the primary label for the block. Iteration over the contained set is used internally
 * in the cfg to resolve equivalent labels.
 * <h3>lock propagation algorithm</h3>
 * The cfg tracks the occurence of monitor enter and monitor exit instructions as they are encountered during
 * the bytecode walk. Note that the relationship between enter and exit instructions is 1 to many. For any given
 * monitor enter there are one or more exits associated with the normal control flow path and zero
 * or more alternative exits associated with exception control flow paths. The association between monitor
 * entry and monitor exit instructions is made available via methods {@link CFG#getPairedEnter(CodeLocation)},
 * and {@link CFG#getPairedExit(CodeLocation, BBlock)} 9note that a given enter will never have more than one
 * exit in any given block).
 * <p/>
 * The cfg associates monitor enters and exits with their enclosing block, allowing it to identify the start and/or
 * end of synchronized regions within a specific block. This information can be propagated along control flow links
 * to identify outstanding monitor enters at any point in a given control flow path. Whenever a block is created
 * it is associated with a set of open enter instructions i.e. enter instructions occurring along all control flow
 * paths to the block for which no corresponding exit has been executed.
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 * <li>For the initial block the open enters list is empty.
 * <p/>
 * <li>For a block reached by normal control flow the open enters list can be derived from any of the feed blocks
 * which transfer control to it. It is computed by adding and removing entries to/from the feed block's open
 * enters list according to the order the enters or exits appear in the block. Any feed block is valid because
 * every enter must have a single corresponding exit on each valid path through the bytecode. Two paths to the
 * same block cannot introduce different enters and exits without breaking this invariant. Also, enters and exits
 * must be strictly nested so the set of open monitors can be tracked using a simple stack model.
 * <p/>
 * The algorithm propagates open enters along normal control flow paths whenever a split instruction is invoked
 * (splitting the instruction stream into a new block). The work is done in method {@link CFG#carryForward()}. This
 * method identifies the current block's open enters list (how will emerge below), updates it with any enters and
 * exits performed in the block and then, for each each outgoing control link, associates the new list with the
 * linked block by inserting the list into a hash table keyed by the block label. Clearly, if the current block was
 * itself arrived at via normal control flow then its open enters list will already be available in the hash table.
 * Handler blocks require a different lookup.
 *<li>
 * Computing the open enters list for a handler block which is the target of exception control flow is also done in
 * method {@link CFG#carryForward()}. This requires identifying all try/catch regions which enclose the block
 * and tagging the corresponding {@link TryCatchDetails} object with the location of any monitor enter instructions
 * which are open at some  point in the try catch region. If this is done for every block encountered during
 * the bytecode walk then at the point where the handler block is split all enter instructions which are still open
 * somewhere within the try/catch region will be listed in the {@link TryCatchDetails}. So, at the split point
 * the old block can be tested to see if it is labelled as a try/catch handler target and, if so, its open enters
 * list can be looked up by locating the {@link TryCatchDetails} associated with the handler start label.
 * </ul>
 * Note that we still need to worry about nested try/catch regions shadowing outer try/catch handlers with a more
 * specific exception type e.g. when a try region with a catch-all handler type is embedded within a try region with
 * a specific exception type or, less commonly, when the inner block employs a super type of the outer block. In these
 * cases exception flow from the inner region cannot reach the handler for the outer region. This means we must
 * dispense with propagation of open monitor enters to the outer region since they will be closed by the inner
 * handler.
 * TODO -- implement this last check
