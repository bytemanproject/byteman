 * A representation of a 1:M relation between labels/code locations. This is used to represent
 * branchouts in a CFG where the 1 is the label of the BBlock and the M lists outgoing normal
 * (non-exception) control flow. It is also used to represent the relationship between basic
 * blocks (identified by their primary label) and labels identifying instructions contained in
 * the block. Note that in the former case the use of labels allows control flow linkes to basic
 * blocks which have not yet been generated to be recorded.
