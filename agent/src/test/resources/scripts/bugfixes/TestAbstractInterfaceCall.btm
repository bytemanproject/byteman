# Test for BYTEMAN-219 to ensure that it is possible to call an interface method
# inherited by an abstract class even if the abstract class does not iself
# implement the method. the interface method will always be defined by any
# instantiable subclass so a call to the method should typecheck ands execute
# correctly.
#
# in this example C3 is an abstract class which implements interface I4
# but leaves it to its subclass C4 to provide the actual implementation of
# method interfaceMethod. The type checker should still detect that this
# method can safely be called on any instance of C3.
