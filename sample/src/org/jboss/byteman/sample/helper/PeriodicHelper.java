/**
 * A helper class which adds a background thread when the helper class is activated and removes the background
 * thread when it is deactivated. The thread loops, calling a specific trigger method, {@link #periodicTrigger}
 * and then waiting for a fixed time. Rule sets which employ the helper class can attach rules to the periodic
 * trigger method in order to perform operations which should happen at regular intervalsx. This is useful,
 * for example, for rule sets which collect statistical information. A periodically triggered rule can read and
 * then rezero a set of stats counters, allowing it to provide regular interval statistics.
 *
 * The basic way to use this class is to employ attach a rule to method {@link #periodicTrigger()}. The rule will
 * be triggered at 10 second intervals. If the period needs to be altered then a rule attached to method
 * {@link #getPeriod()} can be used to return an alternative value. {@link #getPeriod()} is called once when the
 * periodic trigger thread is created. If the wait interval needs to be recomputed before each wait then a rule
 * attached to method {@link #resetPeriod(long)} can be used to return the desired value. The input argument is
 * the value returned by the call to {@link #getPeriod()}.
